# Conference-Notes
Detailed notes from conferences Ive attended

## Summary
I use an automation technique for persisting technical presentation information.   I take a pencil and paper and methodically write notes during each presentation and then consequently transfer the notes to a computer.   The pencil and paper phase forces my mind to focus on what is being said and essentially gives me something to do other than just sitting idly listening.  The second phase is like a conference redux and has the benefit of knowledge iteration.  The process is a little mentally exhausting but it does have a major upside in terms of knowldege persistence.
